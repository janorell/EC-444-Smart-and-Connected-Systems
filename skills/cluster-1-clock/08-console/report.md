## Summary
In this skill set, we learned how to do various things with the ESP32. We first had to create three seperate functions: one that toggled the onboard led, one that would echo what was typed, and one that would convert what decimals were typed into hex. After this we had to put this in a case statement so whenever the letter 's' was typed in, it would move onto the next type.
