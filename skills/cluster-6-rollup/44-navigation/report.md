## Summary
In this skill, we determined the independent tasks needed for executing Quest 6 and outlined flowcharts with the logic of the new tasks that we are implementing. The TAs approved of our process during class and helped us improved our model. We have attached a video with voiceovers explaining our process and the flowcharts separately for reference.
