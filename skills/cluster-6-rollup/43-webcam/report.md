## Summary
For this skill, we set up a live webcam server using the router, the RPi using motion and obviously, a webcam. We did this by setting up the RPi the same way we have been doing all semester and then updating the Pi and installing motion on it. After all of this was done we simply accessed the stream through the ip address of the pi +8081. The photo below is a screenshot of the feed. I am accessing it from my phone.
