#  IR TX/RX

Author: Jennifer Norell, 2019-11-21

## Summary
In this skill, I created an IR receiver that would receive an LED signal that was generated and emitted by both a 38kHz signal from RMT and a serial UART signal. This emitted signal was passed to the H-bridge and once it was received the ESP would light up LEDs based on the corresponding messages sent.
